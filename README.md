# (Arabic Text Summarization) AArTS

## Introduction

Summarization is a crucial task in natural language processing, as it helps to extract the most important information from large amounts of text. With the vast amount of text data available, summarization has become an essential tool for many applications, such as news articles, scientific papers, and product reviews. However, summarization is a challenging task, as it requires understanding the context, identifying the main ideas, and condensing the information into a concise summary.

## Existing Work

Several approaches have been proposed for summarization, including:

1) Extractive summarization: This approach involves selecting the most important sentences or phrases from the original text and combining them into a summary.
2) Abstractive summarization: This approach involves generating a summary from scratch, rather than selecting existing sentences or phrases.
3) Hybrid summarization: This approach combines both extractive and abstractive methods to generate a summary.

There are several neural network architectures that have been proposed for summarization, including:

* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited to sequential data, such as text. They have been used for both extractive and abstractive summarization.
* Transformers: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that are particularly well-suited to tasks that require modeling long-range dependencies. They have been used for abstractive summarization.
* BERT: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that has been fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, including summarization.

## Our Work

Our work focuses on developing a summarization model using transformers. We aim to develop a model that can generate high-quality summaries for a given text. Our model will be trained on a large dataset LANS dataset of text and summaries, and will use an abstractive techniques to generate summaries.

We will evaluate our model using the ROUGE metric, which is a widely-used metric for evaluating the quality of summaries. ROUGE measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary, and provides a score based on the amount of overlap.

We will also compare our model with existing summarization models, such as BERT, to evaluate its performance.

## Future Work

Future work includes further improving the performance of our model by experimenting with different hyperparameters and techniques, such as incorporating additional features or using multi-modal input. Additionally, we plan to explore the use of our model for summarization in other languages.

## Conclusion

In this readme file, we have introduced the problem of summarization and existing work in the field. Our work focuses on developing a summarization model using transformers, and we have outlined our approach and evaluation method. We look forward to contributing to the development of summarization technology and improving the ability of machines to understand and condense text data.
